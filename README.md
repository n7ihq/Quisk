# Quisk
Quisk is a Software Defined Radio by James Ahlstrom, N2ADR. You supply an antenna and a complex (I/Q) mixer to convert the radio spectrum to a low IF. Then send that IF to your computer using the sound card, Ethernet or USB. The Quisk software will read the I/Q data, tune it, filter it, demodulate it, and send the audio to headphones or speakers. Quisk has a microphone input and a key input so it can operate as a complete transceiver. Quisk works with this hardware:

    SoftRock connected to the sound card
    Many other SDR's connected to the sound card
    SDR-IQ connected by USB
    Perseus connected by USB
    N2ADR hardware connected by Ethernet and IP
    HiQSDR hardware connected by Ethernet and IP
    The Hermes-Lite project at hermeslite.com
    Quisk can be used as a pan adapter, and can control some radios
